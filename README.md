# light_conversion
Quick script to calibrate our two light measurement devices

Light was measured with a lux meter (Materials supplementary table) and then transformed from lux units into ÂµW/mm2 with the formula and the luminous efficiency table from http://www.dfisica.ubi.pt/~hgil/Fotometria/HandBook/ch07.html. Since there might be some error by calculating the theoretical conversion (because the Luxmeter does not take into account the wavelength apart from the measurement noise) we decided to rely rather on the empirical calibration.
